# Python Computational Modelling
This repo contains all the computational modelling project that I have done for my master's degree in Theoretical Physics.

### Second year: Computational Physics 201

- Fresnel diffraction from an aperture - Simpson's rule: [Code](https://github.com/dazzabaijan/py_comp_model/blob/master/2nd_year/ex_2/dn16018_ex2_code.py) | [Report](https://github.com/dazzabaijan/py_comp_model/blob/master/2nd_year/ex_2/dn16018_ex2_report.pdf)

  The Simpson's rule is used to first computationally solve 1-d integrals in order to generate Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction patterns. The same rule was then used to solve 2-d integrals in order to generate two dimensional diffraction patterns through apertures of different shapes.
