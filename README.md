# Python Computational Modelling
This repo contains all the computational modelling project that I have done for my master's degree in Theoretical Physics.

### Second year: Computational Physics 201

- Fresnel Diffraction from an Aperture - Simpson's Rule: [Code](https://github.com/dazzabaijan/py_comp_model/blob/master/2nd_year/ex_2/dn16018_ex2_code.py) | [Report](https://github.com/dazzabaijan/py_comp_model/blob/master/2nd_year/ex_2/dn16018_ex2_report.pdf)

  The Simpson's rule is used to first computationally solve 1-D integrals in order to generate Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction patterns. The same rule was then used to solve 2-D integrals in order to generate 2-D diffraction patterns through apertures of different shapes.\
  Library stack: argparse, numpy, math, matplotlib, time

- Free-fall of Felix Baumgartner with Fixed or Varying Drag: [[Code]](https://github.com/dazzabaijan/py_comp_model/blob/master/2nd_year/ex_3/dn16018_ex3_code.py) | [[Report]](https://github.com/dazzabaijan/py_comp_model/blob/master/2nd_year/ex_3/dn16018_ex3_report.pdf)

  Numerical simulation using the modified Euler method to solve ordinary differential equations for a free-fall problem with varying drag at different altitudes and compared against its analytical predictions.\
  Library stack: numpy, matplotlib
  
- Calculation of Basic Rocket Orbits: [Code](https://github.com/dazzabaijan/py_comp_model/blob/master/2nd_year/ex_4/dn16018_ex4_code.py) | [Report](https://github.com/dazzabaijan/py_comp_model/blob/master/2nd_year/ex_4/dn16018_ex4_report.pdf)

  Simulated the orbit of a moving body bounded by a gravitational potential by solving general first order ordinary differential equations using the 4-th order Runge-Kutte method.
